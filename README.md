# Implementation-of-Simple-Linear-Regression-Model-for-Predicting-the-Marks-Scored

## AIM:
To write a program to predict the marks scored by a student using the simple linear regression model.

## Equipments Required:
1. Hardware – PCs
2. Anaconda – Python 3.7 Installation / Jupyter notebook

## Algorithm
1. Import required libraries and create the dataset(Hours_Studied, Marks_scored).
2. Split the data into independent(X) and deoendent(y) variables and perform train-test split.
3. Train the Linear Regression model and predict marks using test data.
4. Evaluate the model(MSE,R^2) and visualize results using a scatter plot and regression plot.

## Result:
Thus the program to implement the simple linear regression model for predicting the marks scored is written and verified using python programming.
